# Runner scripts

These scripts are used to modify the content on the main branch of this
repository.

The scripts are designed to make it easier to interact with a GitHub
repository. Enabling users to upload a plain text format, e.g. CSV which
is then manipulated and republished by these "runners".

GitHub workflows are leveraged to make this possible.

Other publishing techniques can be derived from this work, such as the
publishing of an RSS feed to another location in the repository which
is then accessed via the GitHub raw URL.

This concept takes a huge amount of inspiration from Richard Lehane's
[builder][build-1] for the publishing of the PRONOM Skeleton Suite.
